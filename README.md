## TODO:

* Display a list of single values, horizontally as a bar chart
  * Numerical values should also be displayed inside of the bar
  * The position of values should be customizable too:
    * Top, centre or bottom of the bar.

* Bar sizes should be dependent on the data that gets passed in
  * Bar width should be dependent on the total amount of values passed.
  * Bar height should be dependent on the values of the data.

* Bar properties that should be customizable:
  * Bar Colour
  * Label Colour
  * Bar spacing (space between bars)
  * Bar Chart axes

* X-axis should show labels for each data value
  * Think about how you would need to structure your data to associate a label to each value

* Y-axis should show ticks at certain values
  * Think about where you would configure these values. Should they be part of the data or the options to the bar chart function.

* The title of the bar chart should be able to be set and shown dynamically

* The title of the bar chart should also be customizable:

  * Font Size
  * Font Colour

## Extra

* Multiple Value (Stacked) bar charts
Allow the user to pass multiple values for each bar.
  * Think about how you would need to structure this data compared to a single bar chart.

* This should also support all the features of the single bar chart, including
  * Customizable bar colours, per value
  * Customizable label colours
